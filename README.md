# MongoDB 
This project showcase the powerful integration of MongoDB with data analysis and machine learning workflows.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Car Price Prediction Using ML
**Objective:**  
Build a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, etc., using MongoDB as the backend database.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Efficiently storing, retrieving, and preprocessing car-related data using MongoDB.
- **Model Building:** Implementing regression models to predict car prices with high accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

**Outcome:**  
Achieved a predictive model capable of estimating car prices with a good degree of accuracy, demonstrating the seamless integration of MongoDB with machine learning pipelines.
